5.1 Explain what happens when an investor shorts a certain share.

Investor A contacts their broker with a request to short a share. The broker finds an investor B that holds that share (who is willing to lend it out for a fee), and lends it to investor A. Investor A then sells the share at the current market price. When investor A is ready to close their short position, they buy back the share at the market price at that time, and return it to investor B. Investor A is responsible for covering any interest or dividends paid by the share, and paying it to investor B. If the broker runs out of shares to borrow, investor A will be forced to close their short position.

5.2 What is the difference between the forward price and the value of a forward contract?

The forward price is the price specified in the contract that will be exchanged on the delivery date in exchange for the underlying asset. Forward contracts start out with a value of zero. However, as the price of the underlying asset moves, the value of the forward contract goes up or down.

5.3 Suppose that you enter into a 6-month forward contract on a non-dividend-paying stock when the stock price is $30 and the risk-free interest rate (with continuous compounding) is 12% per annum. What is the forward price?

F0 = S0 * e^(r*t)
   = $30 * e^(0.12 * 6/12)
   = $31.85510
   
5.4 A stock index currently stands at 350. The risk-free interest rate is 8% per annum (with continuous compounding) and the dividend yield on the index is 4% per annum. What should the futures price for a 4-month contract be?

F0 = S0 * e^(r-q * t)
   = 350 * e^((0.08 - 0.04) * 4/12)
   = 354.6979
   
5.5 Explain carefully why the futures price of gold can be calculated from its spot price and other observable variables whereas the futures price of copper cannot.

Gold is an investment asset. Copper is a consumption asset. The futures price of an investment asset can be calculated accurately by making no arbitrage arguments. However, only the upper limit on the futures price for a consumption asset can be calculated using no arbitrage arguments.

5.6 Explain carefully the meaning of the terms convenience yield and cost of carry. What is the relationship between futures price, spot price, convenience yield, and cost of carry?

The benefits from holding the physical asset are sometimes referred to as the convnience yield provided by the commodity. The cost of carry measures the storage cost plus the interest that is paid to finance the asset less the income earned on the asset. F0 = S0*e^(c-y)T.

5.7 Explain why a foreign currency can be treated as an asset providing a known yield.

Each currency has its own risk free interest rate Rf. The interest paid is in the foreign currency, but can be converted to domestic currency at a known rate. Currency futures can therefore be priced using the same equation as a normal asset with a known yield, but we subtitute "q" in the equation to be Rf. This leads to the equation F0 = S0 * e^((R-Rf)*T). 

5.8 Is the futures price of a stock index greater than or less than the expected future value of the index? Explain your answer.

Stock indicies have positive systemic risk, meaning that an investor would expect a return greater than the risk free interest rate. This means that the futures prices of stock indicies will generally understate the expected future spot price.

5.9 A 1-year long forward contract on a non-dividend-paying stock is entered into when the stock price is $40 and the risk-free rate of interest if 10% per annum with continuous compoudning.
a) What are the forward price and the initial value of the forward contract?
b) Six months later, the price of the stock is $45 and the risk-free interest rate is still 10%. What are the forward price and the value of the forward contract?

a) F0 = S0 * e^(r * t)
      = $40 * e^(0.1 * 1)
	  = $44.20684. Initial value is zero

b) F0 = $45 * e^(0.1 * 0.5)
      = $47.30720
	  
Value of forward contract = ($47.30720 - $44.20684) * e^(-0.1 * 0.5)
                          = $2.94915
						  
5.10 The risk-free rate of interest is 7% per annum with continuous compounding, and the dividend yield on a stock index is 3.2% per annum. The current value of the index is 150. What is the 6-month futures price?

F0 = S0 * e^(r-q * t)
   = 150 * e^((0.07 - 0.032) * 0.5)
   = 152.8772
   
5.11 Assume that the risk-free interest rate is 9% per annum with continuous compounding and that the dividend yield on a stock index varies thoughout the year. In Februrary, May, August, and November, dividends are paid at a rate of 5% per annum. In other months, dividends are paid at a rate of 2% per annum. Suppose that the value of the index in July 31 is 1300. What is the futures price for a contract deliverable in December 31 of the same year?

Average dividend yield = (Aug yield + Sept yield + Oct yield + Nov yield + Dec yield) /5 = (5 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 2) / 5 = 3.2%
F0 = 1300 * e^((0.09 - 0.032) * 5/12) = 1331.799

5.12 Suppose that the risk-free interest rate is 10% per annum with continuous compounding and that the dividend yield on a stock index is 4% per annum. The index is standing at 400, and the futures price for a contract deliverable in four months is 405. What arbitrage opportunities does this create?

F0 = 400 * e^((0.1 - 0.04) * 4/12)
   = 408.0805
   
This means that the current futures price is low and a risk free arbitrage opportunity exists by purchasing futures, shorting the stocks underlying the index, and investing the proceeds at the risk free interest rate. 

5.13 Estimate the difference between short-term interest rates in Mexico and the United States on January 8, 2007, from the information in Table 5.4

F0 = S0 * e^(r - rf * t)
0.91025 = 0.91250 * e^(deltaR * 2/12)
deltaR = 0.0148128 = ~1.5% per annum

5.14 The 2-month interest rates in Switzerland and the United States are, respectively, 2% and 5% per annum with continuous compounding. The spot price of the Swiss franc is $0.8000. The futures price for a contract deliverable in 2 months is $0.8100. What arbitrage opportunities does this create?

F0 = 0.8000 * e^((0.05-0.02) * 2/12)
   = 0.804010

Convert to Swiss Franc and short the 2 month futures contracts at $0.8100

5.15 The spot price of silver is $9 per ounce. The storage costs are $0.24 per ounce per year payable quarterly in advance. Assuming that interest rates are 10% per annum for all maturities, calculate the futures price of silver for deliver in 9 months.

Storage costs = $0.06 + $0.06 * e^(0.1 * -3/12) + $0.06 * e^(0.1 * -6/12) = $0.175592
F0 = ($9 + $0.175592) * e^(0.1 * 9/12) = $9.890225

5.16 Suppose that F1 and F2 are two futures contracts on the same commodity with times to maturity, t1 and t2, where t2 > t1. Prove that F2 <= F1 * e(r * (t2 - t1))

If this was not the case, and F2 > F1 * e(r * (t2 - t1)), an arbitrage opportunity exists. You buy the F1 future, Short the F2 contract, borrow money at t1 to make the purchase. Hold the asset until t2 for delivery. You would make F2 - F1 * e^(r * (t2 - t1)).
