5.1 Explain what happens when an investor shorts a certain share.

Investor A contacts their broker with a request to short a share. The broker finds an investor B that holds that share (who is willing to lend it out for a fee), and lends it to investor A. Investor A then sells the share at the current market price. When investor A is ready to close their short position, they buy back the share at the market price at that time, and return it to investor B. Investor A is responsible for covering any interest or dividends paid by the share, and paying it to investor B. If the broker runs out of shares to borrow, investor A will be forced to close their short position.

5.2 What is the difference between the forward price and the value of a forward contract?

The forward price is the price specified in the contract that will be exchanged on the delivery date in exchange for the underlying asset. Forward contracts start out with a value of zero. However, as the price of the underlying asset moves, the value of the forward contract goes up or down.

5.3 Suppose that you enter into a 6-month forward contract on a non-dividend-paying stock when the stock price is $30 and the risk-free interest rate (with continuous compounding) is 12% per annum. What is the forward price?

F0 = S0 * e^(r*t)
   = $30 * e^(0.12 * 6/12)
   = $31.85510
   
5.4 A stock index currently stands at 350. The risk-free interest rate is 8% per annum (with continuous compounding) and the dividend yield on the index is 4% per annum. What should the futures price for a 4-month contract be?

F0 = S0 * e^(r-q * t)
   = 350 * e^((0.08 - 0.04) * 4/12)
   = 354.6979
   
5.5 Explain carefully why the futures price of gold can be calculated from its spot price and other observable variables whereas the futures price of copper cannot.

Gold is an investment asset. Copper is a consumption asset. The futures price of an investment asset can be calculated accurately by making no arbitrage arguments. However, only the upper limit on the futures price for a consumption asset can be calculated using no arbitrage arguments.

5.6 Explain carefully the meaning of the terms convenience yield and cost of carry. What is the relationship between futures price, spot price, convenience yield, and cost of carry?

The benefits from holding the physical asset are sometimes referred to as the convnience yield provided by the commodity. The cost of carry measures the storage cost plus the interest that is paid to finance the asset less the income earned on the asset. F0 = S0*e^(c-y)T.

5.7 Explain why a foreign currency can be treated as an asset providing a known yield.

Each currency has its own risk free interest rate Rf. The interest paid is in the foreign currency, but can be converted to domestic currency at a known rate. Currency futures can therefore be priced using the same equation as a normal asset with a known yield, but we subtitute "q" in the equation to be Rf. This leads to the equation F0 = S0 * e^((R-Rf)*T). 

5.8 Is the futures price of a stock index greater than or less than the expected future value of the index? Explain your answer.

Stock indicies have positive systemic risk, meaning that an investor would expect a return greater than the risk free interest rate. This means that the futures prices of stock indicies will generally understate the expected future spot price.

5.9 A 1-year long forward contract on a non-dividend-paying stock is entered into when the stock price is $40 and the risk-free rate of interest if 10% per annum with continuous compoudning.
a) What are the forward price and the initial value of the forward contract?
b) Six months later, the price of the stock is $45 and the risk-free interest rate is still 10%. What are the forward price and the value of the forward contract?

a) F0 = S0 * e^(r * t)
      = $40 * e^(0.1 * 1)
	  = $44.20684. Initial value is zero

b) F0 = $45 * e^(0.1 * 0.5)
      = $47.30720
	  
Value of forward contract = ($47.30720 - $44.20684) * e^(-0.1 * 0.5)
                          = $2.94915
						  
5.10 The risk-free rate of interest is 7% per annum with continuous compounding, and the dividend yield on a stock index is 3.2% per annum. The current value of the index is 150. What is the 6-month futures price?

F0 = S0 * e^(r-q * t)
   = 150 * e^((0.07 - 0.032) * 0.5)
   = 152.8772
   
5.11 Assume that the risk-free interest rate is 9% per annum with continuous compounding and that the dividend yield on a stock index varies thoughout the year. In Februrary, May, August, and November, dividends are paid at a rate of 5% per annum. In other months, dividends are paid at a rate of 2% per annum. Suppose that the value of the index in July 31 is 1300. What is the futures price for a contract deliverable in December 31 of the same year?

Average dividend yield = (Aug yield + Sept yield + Oct yield + Nov yield + Dec yield) /5 = (5 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 2) / 5 = 3.2%
F0 = 1300 * e^((0.09 - 0.032) * 5/12) = 1331.799

5.12 Suppose that the risk-free interest rate is 10% per annum with continuous compounding and that the dividend yield on a stock index is 4% per annum. The index is standing at 400, and the futures price for a contract deliverable in four months is 405. What arbitrage opportunities does this create?

F0 = 400 * e^((0.1 - 0.04) * 4/12)
   = 408.0805
   
This means that the current futures price is low and a risk free arbitrage opportunity exists by purchasing futures, shorting the stocks underlying the index, and investing the proceeds at the risk free interest rate. 

5.13 Estimate the difference between short-term interest rates in Mexico and the United States on January 8, 2007, from the information in Table 5.4

F0 = S0 * e^(r - rf * t)
0.91025 = 0.91250 * e^(deltaR * 2/12)
deltaR = 0.0148128 = ~1.5% per annum

5.14 The 2-month interest rates in Switzerland and the United States are, respectively, 2% and 5% per annum with continuous compounding. The spot price of the Swiss franc is $0.8000. The futures price for a contract deliverable in 2 months is $0.8100. What arbitrage opportunities does this create?

F0 = 0.8000 * e^((0.05-0.02) * 2/12)
   = 0.804010

Convert to Swiss Franc and short the 2 month futures contracts at $0.8100

5.15 The spot price of silver is $9 per ounce. The storage costs are $0.24 per ounce per year payable quarterly in advance. Assuming that interest rates are 10% per annum for all maturities, calculate the futures price of silver for deliver in 9 months.

Storage costs = $0.06 + $0.06 * e^(0.1 * -3/12) + $0.06 * e^(0.1 * -6/12) = $0.175592
F0 = ($9 + $0.175592) * e^(0.1 * 9/12) = $9.890225

5.16 Suppose that F1 and F2 are two futures contracts on the same commodity with times to maturity, t1 and t2, where t2 > t1. Prove that F2 <= F1 * e(r * (t2 - t1))

If this was not the case, and F2 > F1 * e(r * (t2 - t1)), an arbitrage opportunity exists. You buy the F1 future, Short the F2 contract, borrow money at t1 to make the purchase. Hold the asset until t2 for delivery. You would make F2 - F1 * e^(r * (t2 - t1)).

5.17 When a known future cash outflow in a foreign currency is hedged by a company using a forward contract, there is no foreign exchange risk. When it is hedged using futures contracts, the marking-to-market process does leave the company exposed to some risk. Explain the nature of this risk. In particular, consider whether the company is better off using a futures contract or a forward contract when:
a) The value of the foreign currency falls rapidly during the life of the contract
b) The value of the foreign currency rises rapidly during the life of the contract
c) The value of the foreign currency first rises and then falls back to its initial value
d) The value of the foreign currency first falls and then rises back to its initial value
Assume that the forward price equals the futures price.

The mark-to-market process means that the futures contracts are a slightly imperfect hedge and expose the company to some risk.

Considering the time value of money, it is better to receive profits early and losses later. For this reason the answers are:
a) Forward - Because it pushes the losses father out
b) Futures - Because the profits are realized sooner
c) Futures - Because the profits are realized sooner and the losses are pushed farther out
d) Forward - Because the losses would be pushed father out

5.18 It is sometimes argued that a forward exchange rate is an unbiased predictor of future exchange rates. Under what circumstances is this so?

The only circumstance under which this is true is when the exchange rate has no systematic risk (ie: no correlation with the market's return).

5.19 Show that the growth rate in an index futures price equals the excess return of the index over the risk-free rate. Assume that the risk-free interest rate and the dividend yield are constant.

F0 = S0 * e^((r - q) * T)
F1 = S1 * e^((r - q)*(T-t1))

Futures price growth rate = F1 / F0
                    = (S1 * e^((r - q)*(T-t1))) / (S0 * e^((r - q) * T))
					= S1 / S0 * e^((q - r) t1)
					
5.20 Show that equation (5.3) is true by considering an investment in the asset combined with a short position in a futures contract. Assume that all income from the asset is reinvested in the asset. Use an argument similar to that in footnotes 2 and 4 and explain in detail what an arbitraguer would so if equation (5.3) did not hold.

(5.3)   F0 = S0 * e^((r - q) * T)

Buy one unit of the asset and enter into a short forward contract to sell it for F0 at time T. This costs S0 and is certain to lead to a cash inflow of F0 at time T and since we are reinvesting the income back into the asset, we get e^(q * T) additional asset by time T. The initial outflow is S0. The present value of the inflows is S0 = F0 * e^(-r * T) + F0 * e^(q * T) * e(-r * T)

5.21 Explain carefully what is meant by the expected price of a commodity on a particular future date. Suppose that the futures price for crude oil declines with the maturity of the contract at the rate of 2% per year. Assume that speculators tend to be short crude oil futures and hedges tend to be long. What does the Keynes and Hicks argument imply about the expected futures price?

The expected price of a commodity on a particular future date is the average market participants opinion on what the value of the commodity will be in the future. The Keynes and Hicks argument implies that the expected futures price of crude oil will decline more than 2% per year to make up for the risk that the speculators are taking on to enter into the contract. 

5.22 The Value Line Index is designed to reflect changes in the value of a portfolio of over 1,600 equally weighted stocks. Prior to March 9, 1988, the change in the index from one day to the next was calculated as the geometric average of the changes in the prices of the stocks underlying the index. In these circumstances, does equation (5.8) correctly relate the futures price of the index to its cash price? If not, does the equation overstate or understate the futures price?

No, calculating the index value based on the geometric average of the changes in the underlying stocks would lead to an index price that is too low. Equation 5.8 would then overstate the value of the index futures.

5.23 A US company is interested in using the futures contracts traded on the CME to hedge its Australian dollar exposure. Define r as the interest rate (all maturities) on the US dollar and rf as the interest rate (all maturities) on the Australian dollar. Assume that r and rf are constant and that the company uses a contract expiring at time T to hedge an exposure at time t (T > t).
a) Show that the optimal hedge ratio is e^(rf-r)*(T-t)
b) Show that, when t is 1 day, the optimal hedge ratio is almost exactly S0/F0, where S0 is the current spot price of the currency and F0 is the current futures price of the currency for the contract maturing at time T.
c) Show that the company can take account of the daily settlemenet of futures contracts for a hedge that lasts longer than 1 day by adjusting the hedge ratio so that it always equals the spot price of the currency divided by the futures price of the currency.

a) The futures price formula at time t is:
	
	Ft = St * e^(r - rf)(T - t)
	
The effective spot price obtained with hedging would be:

	h * (F0 - Ft) + St

Combine these formulas to get:

	hF0 - hFt + St
	hF0 - h * St * e^(r - rf)(T - t) + St

If h = e^(rf-r)*(T-t), this reduces to:

	hF0 - St + St
	hF0
	
Which is a zero variance hedge ratio.

b) When t is only 1 day:

h = e^(rf-r)*(T-t) is approx equal to:

h = e^(rf-r)*(T) = S0/F0

c) Since futures are settled daily, they basically act like a series of separate contracts that are rewritten each day. As we see from the answer to b), as long as we adjust our hedge ratio daily so that S0/F0, we will be using appoximately the correct hedge ratio.
