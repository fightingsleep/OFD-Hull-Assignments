5.1 Explain what happens when an investor shorts a certain share.

Investor A contacts their broker with a request to short a share. The broker finds an investor B that holds that share (who is willing to lend it out for a fee), and lends it to investor A. Investor A then sells the share at the current market price. When investor A is ready to close their short position, they buy back the share at the market price at that time, and return it to investor B. Investor A is responsible for covering any interest or dividends paid by the share, and paying it to investor B. If the broker runs out of shares to borrow, investor A will be forced to close their short position.

5.2 What is the difference between the forward price and the value of a forward contract?

The forward price is the price specified in the contract that will be exchanged on the delivery date in exchange for the underlying asset. Forward contracts start out with a value of zero. However, as the price of the underlying asset moves, the value of the forward contract goes up or down.

5.3 Suppose that you enter into a 6-month forward contract on a non-dividend-paying stock when the stock price is $30 and the risk-free interest rate (with continuous compounding) is 12% per annum. What is the forward price?

F0 = S0 * e^(r*t)
   = $30 * e^(0.12 * 6/12)
   = $31.85510
   
5.4 A stock index currently stands at 350. The risk-free interest rate is 8% per annum (with continuous compounding) and the dividend yield on the index is 4% per annum. What should the futures price for a 4-month contract be?

F0 = S0 * e^(r-q * t)
   = 350 * e^((0.08 - 0.04) * 4/12)
   = 354.6979
