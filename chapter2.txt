2.1 Distinguish between the terms open interest and trading volume

Open interest is the total number of contracts outstanding. Volume is the number of contracts being exchanged between buyers and sellings

2.2 What is the difference between a local and commission broker?

Commission brokers are following the instructions of their clients and charge a commission for doing so; locals are trading on their own account.

2.3 Suppose that you enter into a short futures contract to sell July Silver for $10.20 per ounce on the New York Commodity Exchange. The size of the contract is 5000 ounces. The initial margin is $4000, and the maintenance margin is $3000. What change in the futures price will lead to a margin call? What happens if you do not meet the margin call?

If the futures price rises to $10.40 per ounce, a margin call will be issued (since we are short). If you are not able to increase your margin value of your account back to the intitial margin requirement (of $4000), your futures position will be closed.

2.4 Suppose that in September 2009 a company takes a long position in a contract on May 2010 crude oil futures. It closes out its position in March 2010. The futures price (per barrel) is $68.30 when it enters into the contract, $70.50 when it closes out its position, and $69.10 at the end of December 2009. Once contract is for the deliver of 1,000 barrrels. What is the company's total profit? When is it realized? How is it taxed if it is (a) a hedger and (b) a speculator? Assume that the company has a December 31 year-end

Total profit = 1000 * (70.50 - 68.30) = $2200. Since futures contracts have daily settlement, this profit is the accumulation of all of the daily gains and losses summed together.

a) It is taxed in May 2010 on the full $2200
b) Is is taxed in both 2009 and 2010. In 2009 it is taxed on the (1000 * (69.10 - 68.30)) = 800 profit
   In 2010 it is taxed on the remaining (1000 * (70.50 - 69.10)) = $1400 profit
   
2.5 What does a stop order to sell at $2 mean? When might it be used? What does a limit order to sell at $2 mean? When might it be used?

A stop order to sell at $2 means that when the stock price sinks to $2 a market order will be placed to sell the stock. This type of order is used to prevent the stock holder from incurring additional losses if the stock keeps sinking. A limit order to sell at $2 means that the minimum price the trader is willing to sell their stock for is $2 per share. This type of order is used when the trader wishes to sell for a specific price (or above).

2.6 What is the difference between the operation of the margin account administered by a clearinghouse and those administered by a broker?

The clearing house margin account has no maintenance margin (only an original margin). Every day the account balance for each contract must be maintained at an amount equal to the original margin times the number of contracts outstanding.

2.7 What differences exist in the way prices are quoted in the foreign exchange futures market, the foreign exchange spot market, and the foreign exchange forward market?

In the futures market, all FX futures prices where one of the currencies is USD are quoted as the number of USD per unit of foreign currency. Forward prices are always quoted in the same way as spot prices. Spot prices and forward prices are always quoted the same way. This means that for GBP, EUR, AUS, NZD the forward quotes show the number of USD per unit of foreign currency (same as futures market). Howevever, for other major currencies, forward quotes show the number of units of the foreign currency per USD. 

2.8 The party with a short position in a futures contract sometimes has options as to the prcise asset that will be delivered, where delivery will takes place, when deliver will take place, and so on. Do these options increase or decrease the futures price? Explain your reasoning.

No, the futures prices will remain the same. However, when time for deliver comes, price adjustments will be made depending on the quality of asset that is actually going to be delivered.

2.9 What are the most important aspects of the design of a new futures contract?

The asset, the contract size, delivery arrangements, delivery months, price quotes,, price limits and position limits

2.10 Explain how margins protect investors against the possibility of default

Margins ensure that both parties have sufficient funds to honour the contract given a change in the futures price. If one of the parties isn't able to meet the minimum margin requirement, they will be forced to close out their side of the contract. 

2.11 A trader buys two July futures contracts on orange juice. Each contract is for the delivery of 15,000 pounds. The current futures price is 160 cents per pound, the initial margin is $6000 per contract, and the maintencance margin is $4500 per contract. What price change would lead to a margin call? Under what circumstance could $2,000 be withdrawn from the margin account?

A price decrease greater than 10 cents would cause a margin call. A price increase of 6 and 2/3 cents would put you $2000 over the initial margin and allow you to withdraw $2000.

2.12 Show that, if the futures price of a commodity is greater than the spot price during the delivery period, then there is an arbitrage opportunity. Does an arbitrage opportunity exist if the futures price is less than the spot price? Explain your answer. 

a) Sell a futures contract, buy the asset at the spot price, deliver the asset for the futures price
b) Companies interested in acquiring the asset will enter into long futures contracts at the lower price and the demand will increase the futures price to the spot price. There is no arbitrage opportunity though since delivery isn't immediate.

2.13 Explain the differnce betwen a market-if-touched order and a stop order.

A stop sell order is to stop loss if you are long and the asset price is falling. A stop buy order is to stop loss if you are short and the asset price is rising. A market-if-touched sell order is a profit taker order if you are long and the asset price is increasing. A market-if-touched buy order is a profit taker order if you are short and the asset price is falling. 

2.14 Explain what a stop-limit order to sell at 20.30 with a limit of 20.10 means.

This means that if the price of the asset falls to 20.30 or below, sell the asset, but for a minimum price of 20.10.

2.15 At the end of one day a clearinghouse member is long 100 contracts, and the settlement price is $50,000 per contract. The original margin is $2000 per contract. On the following day the member becomes responsible for clearing an additional 20 long contracts, entered into at a price of $51,000 per contract. The settlement price at the end of this day is $50,200. How much does the member have to add to its margin account with the exchange clearinghouse?

Original margin requirement = 100 * $2000 = $200,000
Additional margin for additional contracts = 20 * $2000 = $40,000
Gain in original 100 contract value = 100 * $200 = $20,000
Loss in new 20 contract value = 20 * $800 = $16,000
40,000 - 20,000 + 16,000 = 36,000 need to be added to meet the $240,000 margin requirement

2.16 On July 1, 2009, a Japanese company enters into a forward contract to buy $1 million on January 1, 2010. On September 1, 2009, it enters into a forward contract to sell $1 million on January 1, 2010. Describe the profit or loss the company will make in yen as a function of the forward exchange rates on July 1, 2009, and September 1, 2009.

If the July 1, 2009 forward exchange rate is more favorable than the September 1, 2009 forward exchange rate, the company will profit: 1,000,000 * (E2 - E1). If it is less favorable, they will lose 1,000,000 * (E1 - E2). Keep in mind forward fx rates for Yen will be quoted in Yen per USD 

2.17 The forward price of the Swiss franc for delivery in 45 days is quoted as 1.2500. The futures price for a contract that will be delivered in 45 days is 0.7980. Explain these two quotes. which is more favorable for an investor wanting to sell Swiss Francs?

The forward price is in swiss franc per USD. The futures price is in USD per Swiss franc. To compare them we can convert the forward price to USD per Swiss franc as 1/1.25 = 0.8. Therefore the forward price is more attractive to a investor wanting to sell Swiss Francs.

2.18 Suppose you call your broker and issue instructions to sell one July hogs contract. Describe what happens.

They will request some margin from you to cover the contract. If they are a member of the clearing house they will be required to maintain some margin at the clearing house to cover the trade. If they are not a member of the clearing house, they will be required to maintain some margin with a member of the clearing house. The trade will be sent to the exchange (CME for hogs) and executed. They will charge you some commission. You will recieve confirmation of the trade. 

2.19 "Speculation in the futures markets is pure gambling. It is not in the public interest to allow speculators to trade on a futures exchange." Discuss this viewpoint.

It is in the public interest to allow speculation in the futures market because it increases liquidity and aids proper price discovery. 

2.20 Identify the commodities whose futures contracts have the highest open interest in Table 2.2

Corn, Crude Oil, Sugar, Wheat

2.21 What do you think would happen if an exchange started trading a contract in which the quality of the underlying asset was incompletely specified?

Traders would grow upset with the quality of product that ends up being delivered, and the price would probably sink to a level that represents the lowest quality variant of the product. Traders would probably stop taking positions and liquidity would decrease. 

2.22 "When a futures contract is traded on the floor of the exchange, it may be the case that the open interest increases by one, stays the same, or decreases by one." Explain this statement.

Increases by one = A new contract was issued
Stays the same - One party is closing out their side of the contract, the other party remains
Decreases by one - A contract was closed out

2.23 Suppose that, On October 24, 2009, a company sells one April 2010 live cattle futures contract. It closes out its position on January 21, 2010. The futures price (per poiuund) is 91.20 cents when it enters into the contract, 88.30 cents when it closes out its position, and 88.80 cents at the end of December 2009. One contract is for the delivery of 40,00 pounds of cattle. What is the total profit? How is it taxed if the company is (a) a hedger and (b) a speculator? Assume that the company has a December 31 year-end.

Profit = 40,000 * (0.9120 - 0.8830) = $1160
a) The entire $1160 is taxed in 2010
b) 40,000 * (0.9120 - 0.8880) = $960 taxed in 2009. 40,000 * (0.8880 - 0.8830) = $200 taxed in 2010

2.24 A cattle farmer expects to have 120,000 pounds of live cattle to sell in 3 months. The live cattle futures contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is for the deliver of 40,000 pounds of cattle. How can the farmer use the contract for hedging? From the farmer's viewpoint, what are the pros and cons of hedging?

The farmer can sell 3 cattle futures for delivery in 3 months. This guarantees that the farmer recieves the current cattle futures price 3 months when he sells the cattle. This is a pro to the farmer if the price of cattle falls within the next 3 months. This is a con to the farmer if the price of cattle rises in the next 3 months.

2.25 It is July 2008. A mining company has just discovered a small deposit of gold. It wil take 6 months to construct the mine. The gold will then be extracted on a more or less continuous basis for 1 year. Futures contracts on gold are available on the New York Commodity Exchange. There are delivery months every 2 months from August 2008 to December 2009. Each contract is for the deliver of 100 ounces. Discuss how the mining company might use futures market for hedging.

If it takes the company 6 months to build the mine, they won't be producing gold until January of 2009. Once they have calculated their production quantity, they can begin entering into short gold futures contracts for Feb, Apr, Jun, Aug, Oct, Dec 2009 to cover their 1 year production cycle. This will lock in their profits for 2009.
