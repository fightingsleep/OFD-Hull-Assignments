4.1 A bank quotes an interest rate of 14% per annum with quarterly compounding. What is the equivalent rate with (a) continuous compounding and (b) annual compounding?

a) Rc = m * ln(1 + Rm/m)
Rc = 4 * ln (1 + 0.14/4)
Rc = ‭0.13760570686932958457611309931337‬

b) Rm = m(e^(Rc/m) - 1)
Rm = 1(e^(‭0.13760570686932958457611309931337‬/1)-1)
Rm = ‭‭0.147523000625‬

4.2 What is meant by LIBOR AND LIBID. Which is higher?

Libor = London interbank offered rate
Libid = London interbank bid rate

Libid is lower than libor

4.3 The 6-month and 1-year zero rates are both 10% per annum. For a bond that has a life of 18 months and pays a coupon of 8% per annum (with semiannual payments and one having just been made), the yield is 10.4% per annum. What is the bond's price? What is the 18-month zero rate? All rates are quoted with semiannual compounding.

// TODO: Accidentally used $8 payments instead of $4

Bond price = 8*e^(-0.104 * 0.5) + 8*e^(-0.104 * 1) + 108*e^(-0.104 * 1.5)
= ‭7.5946309347431166603199372544324‬ + ‭7.2098023793696382385781692487184‬ + ‭92.400392560069995051631959908303‬
= ‭107.2066258741099950516319599083‬

1.5 year zero rate = 8*e^(-0.1 * 0.5) + 8*e^(-0.1 * 1) + 108*e^(-rate * 1.5) = 107.2066258741099950516319599083‬
= ‭7.6098353960057120727314025582372‬ + ‭7.2386993442876765853139924755715‬ + 108*e^(-rate * 1.5) = 107.2066258741099950516319599083‬
e^(-rate * 1.5) = ‭0.85516751049830186427764821781878‬
‭-rate * 1.5 = -0.15645791052347706122797506974209‬
-rate = ‭-0.10430527368231804081865004649473‬
rate = 0.10430527368231804081865004649473‬
