4.1 A bank quotes an interest rate of 14% per annum with quarterly compounding. What is the equivalent rate with (a) continuous compounding and (b) annual compounding?

a) Rc = m * ln(1 + Rm/m)
Rc = 4 * ln (1 + 0.14/4)
Rc = ‭0.13760570686932958457611309931337‬

b) Rm = m(e^(Rc/m) - 1)
Rm = 1(e^(‭0.13760570686932958457611309931337‬/1)-1)
Rm = ‭‭0.147523000625‬

4.2 What is meant by LIBOR AND LIBID. Which is higher?

Libor = London interbank offered rate
Libid = London interbank bid rate

Libid is lower than libor

4.3 The 6-month and 1-year zero rates are both 10% per annum. For a bond that has a life of 18 months and pays a coupon of 8% per annum (with semiannual payments and one having just been made), the yield is 10.4% per annum. What is the bond's price? What is the 18-month zero rate? All rates are quoted with semiannual compounding.

// TODO: Accidentally used $8 payments instead of $4

Bond price = 8*e^(-0.104 * 0.5) + 8*e^(-0.104 * 1) + 108*e^(-0.104 * 1.5)
= ‭7.5946309347431166603199372544324‬ + ‭7.2098023793696382385781692487184‬ + ‭92.400392560069995051631959908303‬
= ‭107.2066258741099950516319599083‬

1.5 year zero rate = 8*e^(-0.1 * 0.5) + 8*e^(-0.1 * 1) + 108*e^(-rate * 1.5) = 107.2066258741099950516319599083‬
= ‭7.6098353960057120727314025582372‬ + ‭7.2386993442876765853139924755715‬ + 108*e^(-rate * 1.5) = 107.2066258741099950516319599083‬
e^(-rate * 1.5) = ‭0.85516751049830186427764821781878‬
‭-rate * 1.5 = -0.15645791052347706122797506974209‬
-rate = ‭-0.10430527368231804081865004649473‬
rate = 0.10430527368231804081865004649473‬

4.4 An investor recieves $1,100 in one year in return for an investmenet of $1,000 now. Calculate the percentage return per annum with:
a) Annual compounding
b) Semiannual compounding
c) Monthly compounding
d) Continuous componding

Zero rate (compounded annually) = 10%
continuous compounding = ln(1 + 0.1) = 0.09531017980432486004395212328077

a) 10%
b) 2 * (e^(0.09531017980432486004395212328077 / 2) - 1) = 0.09761769634030309398290702735988
c) 12 * (e^(0.09531017980432486004395212328077 / 12) - 1) = ‭0.09568968514684489279238213067877‬
d) 0.09531017980432486004395212328077

4.5 Suppose that zero interest rates with continuous compounding are as follows. Calculate forward interest rates for the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth quarters.

Second quarter = $100 * e^(0.08 * 0.25) * e^(r * 0.25) = $100 * e^(0.082 * 0.5)
‭102.02013400267558101601439204832‬ * e^(r * 0.25) = ‭104.18521055454795493337734638249‬
r = ‭0.08399999999999999999999999999981‬

Third quarter = $100 * e^(0.082 * 0.5) * e^(r * 0.25) = $100 * e^(0.084 * 0.75)
‭104.18521055454795493337734638249‬ * e^(r * 0.25) = ‭106.50268392313054643029450234071‬
= ‭0.08800000000000000000000000000017‬

Fourth quarter = ((R2 * T2) - (R1 * T1)) / (T2 - T1) = ((0.085 * 1) - (0.084 * 0.75)) / (1 - 0.75) = ‭0.088‬

Fifth quarter = ((R2 * T2) - (R1 * T1)) / (T2 - T1) = (0.086 * 1.25) - (0.085 * 1) / (1.25 - 1) = 0.09

Sixth quarter = ((R2 * T2) - (R1 * T1)) / (T2 - T1) = ((0.087 * 1.5) - (0.086 * 1.25)) / (1.5 - 1.25) = 0.092

4.6 Assuming that zero rates are as in Problem 4.5, what is the value of an FRA that enables the holder to earn 9.5% for a 3-month period starting in 1 year on a principal of $1,000,000? The interest rate is expressed with quarterly compounding.

Convert forward libor rate to quarterly compounding = 4* (e^(0.09/4) - 1) = 0.0910201

Vfra = L(Rk - Rf)(T2-T1)e^(-R2T2) = $1,000,000 * (0.095 - 0.0910201) * (1.25 - 1.0) * e^(-0.086 * 1.25) = $893.56

4.7 The term structure of interest rates is upward-sloping. Put the following in order of magnitude:

a) The 5-year zero rate
b) The yield on a 5-year coupon-bearing bond
c) The forward rate correspoinding to the period between 4.75 and 5 years in the future

What is the answer to this aquestion when the term structure of interest rates is downward sloping?

Upward sloping scenario = b < a < c
Downward sloping scenario = c < a < b

4.8 What does duration tell you about the sensitivity of a bond portfolio to interest rates. What are the limitations of the duration measure?

The longer the duration, the higher the sensitivity to interest rates. Duration can be used to measure the change in a bonds price with respect to a small parallel shift in the yield curve. However, the duration measure doesn't work for large or non-parallel shifts in the yield curve.

4.9 What rate of interest with continuous compounding is equivalent to 15% per annum with monthly compounding?

e^(r*t) = (1 + r/n)^(n*t)
e^(r*t) = (1 + 0.15 / 12)^12
e^(r*t)	= ‭1.1607545177229987146472703898326‬
r = ln(1.1607545177229987146472703898326‬)
r = ‭0.14907023998268583973551754357451‬

4.10 A deposit account pays 12% per annum with continuous compounding, but interest is actually paid quarterly. How much interest will be paid each quarter on a $10,000 deposit?

e^(r*t) = (1 + r/n)^(n*t)
e^(0.12*1) = (1 + r/4)^(4*1)
‭1.1274968515793756714792655693748‬ = (1 + r/4)^(4*1)
‭1.0304545339535168556124399538312‬= 1 + r/4
‭0.0304545339535168556124399538312‬= r/4
‭0.12181813581406742244975981532479‬ = r

$10,000 * (1 + 0.12181813581406742244975981532479‬ / 4)^(4 * 0.25) = ‭10,304.545339535168556124399538312‬
Payment of  $304.545339535168556124399538312‬ per quarter 

4.11 Suppose that 6-month, 12-month, 18-month, 24-month, and 30-month zero rates are respectively, 4%, 4.2%, 4.4%, 4.6%, and 4.8% per annum, with continuous compounding. Estimate the cash price of a bond with a face value of 100 that will mature in 30 months and pays a coupon of 4% per annum semiannually.

$2 coupon payments every 6 months discounted using provided zero rates =
$2 * e^(-0.04 * 0.5) + $2 * e^(-0.042 * 1) + $2 * e^(-0.044 * 1.5) + $2 * e^(-0.046 * 2) + $102 * e^(-0.048 * 2.5)
$98.04

4.12 A 3-year bond provides a coupon of 8% semiannually and has a cash price of 104. What is the bond's yield?

The bonds yield is the single discount factor that makes the bond price to its market price
104 = $4 * e^(-y * 0.5) + $4 * e^(-y * 1) + $4 * e^(-y * 1.5) + $4 * e^(-y * 2) + $4 * e^(-y * 2.5) + $104 * e^(-y * 3)
y = 0.0640697 = 6.40697%

4.13 Suppose that the 6-month, 12-month, 18-month, and 24-month zero rates are 5%, 6%, 6.5%, and 7%, respectively. What is the 2-year par yield?

100 = C/2 * e^(-0.05 * 0.5) + C/2 * e^(-0.06 * 1) + C/2 * e^(-0.065 * 1.5) + ((100 + C/2) * e^(-0.07 * 2))
C = 7.07408% with semiannual compounding

4.14 Suppose that zero interest rates with continuous compounding are as follows. Calculate forward interest rates for the second, third, fourth, and fifth years. 

100 * e^(0.02 * 1) * e^(r * 1) = 100 * e^(0.03 * 2)
r = 0.04 = 4%

100 * e^(0.03 * 2) * e^(r * 1) = 100 * e^(0.037 * 3)
r = 0.051 = 5.1%

100 * e^(0.037 * 3) * e^(r * 1) = 100 * e^(0.042 * 4)
r = 0.057 = 5.7%

100 * e^(0.042 * 4) * e^(r * 1) = 100 * e^(0.045 * 5)
r = 0.057 = 5.7%

1 year rate between year 1 and year 2 = 4%
1 year rate between year 2 and year 3 = 5.1%
1 year rate between year 3 and year 4 = 5.7%
1 year rate between year 4 and year 5 = 5.7%

4.15 Use the rates in Problem 4.14 to value an FRA where you will pay 5% (compounded annually) for the third year on $1 million.

Forward interest rate (continuous compounding) for the third year (ie: Between year 2 and 3) is 5.1% (calculated in the last question).
Change this to annual compounding:
e^(r*t) = (1 + r/n)^(n*t)
e^(0.051*1) = (1 + r/1)^(1*1)
r = 0.0523229

Vfra = L(Rf - Rk)(T2-T1)e^(-R2T2)
= $1,000,000 * (0.0523229 - 0.05) * (3 - 2) * e(-0.037*3)
= $2078.85

4.16 A 10-year 8% coupon bond currently sells for $90. A 10-year 4% coupon bond currently sells for $80. What is the 10-year zero rate? (Hint: Consider taking a long position in two of the 4% coupon bonds and a short position in one of the 8% coupon bonds.)

Long position in two 4% bonds and short position in one 8% bond:
 todays portfolio setup cost: 2 * -$80 + $90 = -$70
 final principal payout: 2 * $100 - $100 = $100
 
All coupon payments cancel each other out. So todays setup cost equals the present value of the future principal payout:

$70 = $100 * e^(-r*10) = 0.035667494393873237891263871124118447796401675904691178757

4.17 Explain carefully why liquidity preference theory is consistent with the observation that the term structure of interest rates tends to be upward-sloping more often than downward-sloping.

If interest rates are equally likely to move up or down, investors and lenders have incentive to lock-up their money for short periods of time so that they can potentially reinvest their money at a higher interest rate. If interest rates are equally likely to move up or down, borrows have incentive to lock-in their interest rate for the longest period of time to prevent losing money when interest rates rise. For these reasons, short term interest rates tend to be lower since their is less liquidity risk for lenders, but also more risk for borrowers. Long interest rates tend to be higher because their is more liquidity risk for lenders, but less risk for borrowers.

4.18 "When the zero curve is upward-sloping, the zero rate for a particular maturity is greater than the par yield for that maturity. When the zero curve is downward-sloping the reverse is true." Explain why this is so.

The par yield on a coupon bearing bond (B) with maturity (M) is the coupon rate (C) that makes the bond price to its face value. The interest payments calculated with coupon (C) are discounted using zero rates at maturities that are less than maturity (M). If the zero curve is upward sloping, these discount factors at maturities less than (M) will be lower than the discount factor calculated at (M). This means that (C) doesn't need to be as high as the zero rate at maturity (M) to make bond (B) price to its face value.

4.19 Why are US Treasury rates significantly lower than other rate that are close to risk-free?

A number of tax and regulatory issues cause Treasury rates to be artifically low. Financial institutions and derivative traders consider Libor to be a better representation of the true risk-free rate.

4.20 Why does a loan in the repo market involve very little credit risk?

Each loan is backed by collateral that can be sold in the case that the borrower is unable to buy back the collateral. If the lender is unwilling to give back the collateral, the borrower can simply keep the money that they borrowed. This leads to very little credit risk for both parties involved.

4.21 Explain why an FRA is equivalent to the exchange of a floating rate of interest for a fixed rate of interest.

A forward rate agreement is an agreement that a specific interest rate will apply to either borrowing or lending a certain principal amount during a future time period. This means that after you enter into an FRA, you no longer have to be concerned about interest rate movements (ie: the floating rate) because the agreed upon interest rate (ie: the fixed rate) will apply to the future period regardless of the interest rates at that time.

4.22 A 5-year bond with a yield of 11% (continuously compounded) pays an 8% coupon at the end of each year.
a) What is the bond's price?
b) What is the bond's duration?
c) Use the duration to calculate the effect on the bond's price of a 0.2% decrease in its yield.
d) Recalculate the bond's price on the basis of a 10.8% per annum yield and verify that the result is in agreement with your answer to c)

a) $8 * e^(-0.11*1) + $8 * e^(-0.11*2) + $8 * e^(-0.11*3) + $8 * e^(-0.11*4) + $108 * e^(-0.11*5) = $86.8011
b) 1 * (($8 * e^(-0.11*1)) / $86.8011) + 2 * (($8 * e^(-0.11*2)) / $86.8011) + 3 * (($8 * e^(-0.11*3)) / $86.8011) + 4 * (($8 * e^(-0.11*4)) / $86.8011) + 5 * (($108 * e^(-0.11*5)) / $86.8011) = 4.25597
c) Since the yield is expressed using continuous componding, the macaulay duration calculated in b) is equal to the modified duration. Meaning the following formula can be used:

DeltaB = -B*D*DeltaY
       = -$86.8011 * 4.25597 * -0.002
	   = 0.738845755134
	
Therefore the bonds price would be $86.8011 + $0.738845755134 = $87.539945755134

d) $8 * e^(-0.108*1) + $8 * e^(-0.108*2) + $8 * e^(-0.108*3) + $8 * e^(-0.108*4) + $108 * e^(-0.108*5) = $87.5434. Which is what our answer in c) predicted (to two decimal places).

4.23 The cash prices of 6-month and 1-year Treasury bills are 94.0 and 89.0. A 1.5 year bond that will pay coupons of 4$ every 6 months currently sells for $94.84. A 2-year bond that will pay coupons of $5 every 6 months currently sells for $97.12. Calculate the 6-month, 1-year, 1.5 year, and 2-year zero rates.

6 month zero rate: $100 is paid at maturity on an investment of $94. This is a $6 return in 6 months. 2 * ($6 / $94) = ‭12.765957446808510638297872340426‬% per annum with semiannual componding. Converting to continuous compounding we get: 2 * ln(1 + 0.12765957446808510638297872340426 / 2) = 0.12375080743617494359560023627676 = 12.375080743617494359560023627676

1 year zero rate: $100 is paid at maturity on an investment of $89.0. This is a return of $11 in 1 year. $11 / $89 = ‭12.359550561797752808988764044944‬% per annum with annual compounding. Converting to continuous compounding we get: ln(1 + 0.12359550561797752808988764044944) = 0.11653381625595152971816736869888 = 11.653381625595152971816736869888%

1.5 year zero rate:

$94.84= $4 * e^(-0.12375080743617494359560023627676 * 0.5) + $4 * e^(-0.11653381625595152971816736869888 * 1) + $104 * e^(-r * 1.5)
= 0.115015706978467726026337071918806466094717715405604253138
= 11.5015706978467726026337071918806466094717715405604253138%

2 year zero rate:

$97.12 = $5 * e^(-0.12375080743617494359560023627676 * 0.5) + $5 * e^(-0.11653381625595152971816736869888 * 1) + $5 * e^(-0.115015706978467726026337071918806466094717715405604253138 * 1.5) + $105 * e^(-r * 2) = 0.11299 = 11.299%
