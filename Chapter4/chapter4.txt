4.1 A bank quotes an interest rate of 14% per annum with quarterly compounding. What is the equivalent rate with (a) continuous compounding and (b) annual compounding?

a) Rc = m * ln(1 + Rm/m)
Rc = 4 * ln (1 + 0.14/4)
Rc = ‭0.13760570686932958457611309931337‬

b) Rm = m(e^(Rc/m) - 1)
Rm = 1(e^(‭0.13760570686932958457611309931337‬/1)-1)
Rm = ‭‭0.147523000625‬

4.2 What is meant by LIBOR AND LIBID. Which is higher?

Libor = London interbank offered rate
Libid = London interbank bid rate

Libid is lower than libor

4.3 The 6-month and 1-year zero rates are both 10% per annum. For a bond that has a life of 18 months and pays a coupon of 8% per annum (with semiannual payments and one having just been made), the yield is 10.4% per annum. What is the bond's price? What is the 18-month zero rate? All rates are quoted with semiannual compounding.

// TODO: Accidentally used $8 payments instead of $4

Bond price = 8*e^(-0.104 * 0.5) + 8*e^(-0.104 * 1) + 108*e^(-0.104 * 1.5)
= ‭7.5946309347431166603199372544324‬ + ‭7.2098023793696382385781692487184‬ + ‭92.400392560069995051631959908303‬
= ‭107.2066258741099950516319599083‬

1.5 year zero rate = 8*e^(-0.1 * 0.5) + 8*e^(-0.1 * 1) + 108*e^(-rate * 1.5) = 107.2066258741099950516319599083‬
= ‭7.6098353960057120727314025582372‬ + ‭7.2386993442876765853139924755715‬ + 108*e^(-rate * 1.5) = 107.2066258741099950516319599083‬
e^(-rate * 1.5) = ‭0.85516751049830186427764821781878‬
‭-rate * 1.5 = -0.15645791052347706122797506974209‬
-rate = ‭-0.10430527368231804081865004649473‬
rate = 0.10430527368231804081865004649473‬

4.4 An investor recieves $1,100 in one year in return for an investmenet of $1,000 now. Calculate the percentage return per annum with:
a) Annual compounding
b) Semiannual compounding
c) Monthly compounding
d) Continuous componding

Zero rate (compounded annually) = 10%
continuous compounding = ln(1 + 0.1) = 0.09531017980432486004395212328077

a) 10%
b) 2 * (e^(0.09531017980432486004395212328077 / 2) - 1) = 0.09761769634030309398290702735988
c) 12 * (e^(0.09531017980432486004395212328077 / 12) - 1) = ‭0.09568968514684489279238213067877‬
d) 0.09531017980432486004395212328077

4.5 Suppose that zero interest rates with continuous compounding are as follows. Calculate forward interest rates for the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth quarters.

Second quarter = $100 * e^(0.08 * 0.25) * e^(r * 0.25) = $100 * e^(0.082 * 0.5)
‭102.02013400267558101601439204832‬ * e^(r * 0.25) = ‭104.18521055454795493337734638249‬
r = ‭0.08399999999999999999999999999981‬

Third quarter = $100 * e^(0.082 * 0.5) * e^(r * 0.25) = $100 * e^(0.084 * 0.75)
‭104.18521055454795493337734638249‬ * e^(r * 0.25) = ‭106.50268392313054643029450234071‬
= ‭0.08800000000000000000000000000017‬

Fourth quarter = ((R2 * T2) - (R1 * T1)) / (T2 - T1) = ((0.085 * 1) - (0.084 * 0.75)) / (1 - 0.75) = ‭0.088‬

Fifth quarter = ((R2 * T2) - (R1 * T1)) / (T2 - T1) = (0.086 * 1.5) - (0.085 * 1) / (1.5 - 1)
