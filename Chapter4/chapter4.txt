4.1 A bank quotes an interest rate of 14% per annum with quarterly compounding. What is the equivalent rate with (a) continuous compounding and (b) annual compounding?

a) Rc = m * ln(1 + Rm/m)
Rc = 4 * ln (1 + 0.14/4)
Rc = ‭0.13760570686932958457611309931337‬

b) Rm = m(e^(Rc/m) - 1)
Rm = 1(e^(‭0.13760570686932958457611309931337‬/1)-1)
Rm = ‭‭0.147523000625‬

4.2 What is meant by LIBOR AND LIBID. Which is higher?

Libor = London interbank offered rate
Libid = London interbank bid rate

Libid is lower than libor

4.3 The 6-month and 1-year zero rates are both 10% per annum. For a bond that has a life of 18 months and pays a coupon of 8% per annum (with semiannual payments and one having just been made), the yield is 10.4% per annum. What is the bond's price? What is the 18-month zero rate? All rates are quoted with semiannual compounding.

// TODO: Accidentally used $8 payments instead of $4

Bond price = 8*e^(-0.104 * 0.5) + 8*e^(-0.104 * 1) + 108*e^(-0.104 * 1.5)
= ‭7.5946309347431166603199372544324‬ + ‭7.2098023793696382385781692487184‬ + ‭92.400392560069995051631959908303‬
= ‭107.2066258741099950516319599083‬

1.5 year zero rate = 8*e^(-0.1 * 0.5) + 8*e^(-0.1 * 1) + 108*e^(-rate * 1.5) = 107.2066258741099950516319599083‬
= ‭7.6098353960057120727314025582372‬ + ‭7.2386993442876765853139924755715‬ + 108*e^(-rate * 1.5) = 107.2066258741099950516319599083‬
e^(-rate * 1.5) = ‭0.85516751049830186427764821781878‬
‭-rate * 1.5 = -0.15645791052347706122797506974209‬
-rate = ‭-0.10430527368231804081865004649473‬
rate = 0.10430527368231804081865004649473‬

4.4 An investor recieves $1,100 in one year in return for an investmenet of $1,000 now. Calculate the percentage return per annum with:
a) Annual compounding
b) Semiannual compounding
c) Monthly compounding
d) Continuous componding

Zero rate (compounded annually) = 10%
continuous compounding = ln(1 + 0.1) = 0.09531017980432486004395212328077

a) 10%
b) 2 * (e^(0.09531017980432486004395212328077 / 2) - 1) = 0.09761769634030309398290702735988
c) 12 * (e^(0.09531017980432486004395212328077 / 12) - 1) = ‭0.09568968514684489279238213067877‬
d) 0.09531017980432486004395212328077

4.5 Suppose that zero interest rates with continuous compounding are as follows. Calculate forward interest rates for the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth quarters.

Second quarter = $100 * e^(0.08 * 0.25) * e^(r * 0.25) = $100 * e^(0.082 * 0.5)
‭102.02013400267558101601439204832‬ * e^(r * 0.25) = ‭104.18521055454795493337734638249‬
r = ‭0.08399999999999999999999999999981‬

Third quarter = $100 * e^(0.082 * 0.5) * e^(r * 0.25) = $100 * e^(0.084 * 0.75)
‭104.18521055454795493337734638249‬ * e^(r * 0.25) = ‭106.50268392313054643029450234071‬
= ‭0.08800000000000000000000000000017‬

Fourth quarter = ((R2 * T2) - (R1 * T1)) / (T2 - T1) = ((0.085 * 1) - (0.084 * 0.75)) / (1 - 0.75) = ‭0.088‬

Fifth quarter = ((R2 * T2) - (R1 * T1)) / (T2 - T1) = (0.086 * 1.25) - (0.085 * 1) / (1.25 - 1) = 0.09

Sixth quarter = ((R2 * T2) - (R1 * T1)) / (T2 - T1) = ((0.087 * 1.5) - (0.086 * 1.25)) / (1.5 - 1.25) = 0.092

4.6 Assuming that zero rates are as in Problem 4.5, what is the value of an FRA that enables the holder to earn 9.5% for a 3-month period starting in 1 year on a principal of $1,000,000? The interest rate is expressed with quarterly compounding.

Convert forward libor rate to quarterly compounding = 4* (e^(0.09/4) - 1) = 0.0910201

Vfra = L(Rk - Rf)(T2-T1)e^(-R2T2) = $1,000,000 * (0.095 - 0.0910201) * (1.25 - 1.0) * e^(-0.086 * 1.25) = $893.56

4.7 The term structure of interest rates is upward-sloping. Put the following in order of magnitude:

a) The 5-year zero rate
b) The yield on a 5-year coupon-bearing bond
c) The forward rate correspoinding to the period between 4.75 and 5 years in the future

What is the answer to this aquestion when the term structure of interest rates is downward sloping?

Upward sloping scenario = b < a < c
Downward sloping scenario = c < a < b

4.8 What does duration tell you about the sensitivity of a bond portfolio to interest rates. What are the limitations of the duration measure?

The longer the duration, the higher the sensitivity to interest rates. Duration doesn't give you an idea of how quickly
