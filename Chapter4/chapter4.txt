4.1 A bank quotes an interest rate of 14% per annum with quarterly compounding. What is the equivalent rate with (a) continuous compounding and (b) annual compounding?

a) Rc = m * ln(1 + Rm/m)
Rc = 4 * ln (1 + 0.14/4)
Rc = ‭0.13760570686932958457611309931337‬

b) Rm = m(e^(Rc/m) - 1)
Rm = 1(e^(‭0.13760570686932958457611309931337‬/1)-1)
Rm = ‭‭0.147523000625‬

4.2 What is meant by LIBOR AND LIBID. Which is higher?

Libor = London interbank offered rate
Libid = London interbank bid rate

Libid is lower than libor

4.3 The 6-month and 1-year zero rates are both 10% per annum. For a bond that has a life of 18 months and pays a coupon of 8% per annum (with semiannual payments and one having just been made), the yield is 10.4% per annum. What is the bond's price? What is the 18-month zero rate? All rates are quoted with semiannual compounding.

// TODO: Accidentally used $8 payments instead of $4

Bond price = 8*e^(-0.104 * 0.5) + 8*e^(-0.104 * 1) + 108*e^(-0.104 * 1.5)
= ‭7.5946309347431166603199372544324‬ + ‭7.2098023793696382385781692487184‬ + ‭92.400392560069995051631959908303‬
= ‭107.2066258741099950516319599083‬

1.5 year zero rate = 8*e^(-0.1 * 0.5) + 8*e^(-0.1 * 1) + 108*e^(-rate * 1.5) = 107.2066258741099950516319599083‬
= ‭7.6098353960057120727314025582372‬ + ‭7.2386993442876765853139924755715‬ + 108*e^(-rate * 1.5) = 107.2066258741099950516319599083‬
e^(-rate * 1.5) = ‭0.85516751049830186427764821781878‬
‭-rate * 1.5 = -0.15645791052347706122797506974209‬
-rate = ‭-0.10430527368231804081865004649473‬
rate = 0.10430527368231804081865004649473‬

4.4 An investor recieves $1,100 in one year in return for an investmenet of $1,000 now. Calculate the percentage return per annum with:
a) Annual compounding
b) Semiannual compounding
c) Monthly compounding
d) Continuous componding

Zero rate (compounded annually) = 10%
continuous compounding = ln(1 + 0.1) = 0.09531017980432486004395212328077

a) 10%
b) 2 * (e^(0.09531017980432486004395212328077 / 2) - 1) = 0.09761769634030309398290702735988
c) 12 * (e^(0.09531017980432486004395212328077 / 12) - 1) = ‭0.09568968514684489279238213067877‬
d) 0.09531017980432486004395212328077

4.5 Suppose that zero interest rates with continuous compounding are as follows. Calculate forward interest rates for the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth quarters.

Second quarter = $100 * e^(0.08 * 0.25) * e^(r * 0.25) = $100 * e^(0.082 * 0.5)
‭102.02013400267558101601439204832‬ * e^(r * 0.25) = ‭104.18521055454795493337734638249‬
r = ‭0.08399999999999999999999999999981‬

Third quarter = $100 * e^(0.082 * 0.5) * e^(r * 0.25) = $100 * e^(0.084 * 0.75)
‭104.18521055454795493337734638249‬ * e^(r * 0.25) = ‭106.50268392313054643029450234071‬
= ‭0.08800000000000000000000000000017‬

Fourth quarter = ((R2 * T2) - (R1 * T1)) / (T2 - T1) = ((0.085 * 1) - (0.084 * 0.75)) / (1 - 0.75) = ‭0.088‬

Fifth quarter = ((R2 * T2) - (R1 * T1)) / (T2 - T1) = (0.086 * 1.25) - (0.085 * 1) / (1.25 - 1) = 0.09

Sixth quarter = ((R2 * T2) - (R1 * T1)) / (T2 - T1) = ((0.087 * 1.5) - (0.086 * 1.25)) / (1.5 - 1.25) = 0.092

4.6 Assuming that zero rates are as in Problem 4.5, what is the value of an FRA that enables the holder to earn 9.5% for a 3-month period starting in 1 year on a principal of $1,000,000? The interest rate is expressed with quarterly compounding.

Convert forward libor rate to quarterly compounding = 4* (e^(0.09/4) - 1) = 0.0910201

Vfra = L(Rk - Rf)(T2-T1)e^(-R2T2) = $1,000,000 * (0.095 - 0.0910201) * (1.25 - 1.0) * e^(-0.086 * 1.25) = $893.56

4.7 The term structure of interest rates is upward-sloping. Put the following in order of magnitude:

a) The 5-year zero rate
b) The yield on a 5-year coupon-bearing bond
c) The forward rate correspoinding to the period between 4.75 and 5 years in the future

What is the answer to this aquestion when the term structure of interest rates is downward sloping?

Upward sloping scenario = b < a < c
Downward sloping scenario = c < a < b

4.8 What does duration tell you about the sensitivity of a bond portfolio to interest rates. What are the limitations of the duration measure?

The longer the duration, the higher the sensitivity to interest rates. Duration can be used to measure the change in a bonds price with respect to a small parallel shift in the yield curve. However, the duration measure doesn't work for large or non-parallel shifts in the yield curve.

4.9 What rate of interest with continuous compounding is equivalent to 15% per annum with monthly compounding?

e^(r*t) = (1 + r/n)^(n*t)
e^(r*t) = (1 + 0.15 / 12)^12
e^(r*t)	= ‭1.1607545177229987146472703898326‬
r = ln(1.1607545177229987146472703898326‬)
r = ‭0.14907023998268583973551754357451‬

4.10 A deposit account pays 12% per annum with continuous compounding, but interest is actually paid quarterly. How much interest will be paid each quarter on a $10,000 deposit?

e^(r*t) = (1 + r/n)^(n*t)
e^(0.12*1) = (1 + r/4)^(4*1)
‭1.1274968515793756714792655693748‬ = (1 + r/4)^(4*1)
‭1.0304545339535168556124399538312‬= 1 + r/4
‭0.0304545339535168556124399538312‬= r/4
‭0.12181813581406742244975981532479‬ = r

$10,000 * (1 + 0.12181813581406742244975981532479‬ / 4)^(4 * 0.25) = ‭10,304.545339535168556124399538312‬
Payment of  $304.545339535168556124399538312‬ per quarter 

4.11 Suppose that 6-month, 12-month, 18-month, 24-month, and 30-month zero rates are respectively, 4%, 4.2%, 4.4%, 4.6%, and 4.8% per annum, with continuous compounding. Estimate the cash price of a bond with a face value of 100 that will mature in 30 months and pays a coupon of 4% per annum semiannually.

$2 coupon payments every 6 months discounted using provided zero rates =
$2 * e^(-0.04 * 0.5) + $2 * e^(-0.042 * 1) + $2 * e^(-0.044 * 1.5) + $2 * e^(-0.046 * 2) + $102 * e^(-0.048 * 2.5)
$98.04

4.12 A 3-year bond provides a coupon of 8% semiannually and has a cash price of 104. What is the bond's yield?

The bonds yield is the single discount factor that makes the bond price to its market price
104 = $4 * e^(-y * 0.5) + $4 * e^(-y * 1) + $4 * e^(-y * 1.5) + $4 * e^(-y * 2) + $4 * e^(-y * 2.5) + $104 * e^(-y * 3)
y = 0.0640697 = 6.40697%

4.13 Suppose that the 6-month, 12-month, 18-month, and 24-month zero rates are 5%, 6%, 6.5%, and 7%, respectively. What is the 2-year par yield?

100 = C/2 * e^(-0.05 * 0.5) + C/2 * e^(-0.06 * 1) + C/2 * e^(-0.065 * 1.5) + ((100 + C/2) * e^(-0.07 * 2))
C = 7.07408% with semiannual compounding

4.14 Suppose that zero interest rates with continuous compounding are as follows. Calculate forward interest rates for the second, third, fourth, and fifth years. 

100 * e^(0.02 * 1) * e^(r * 1) = 100 * e^(0.03 * 2)
r = 0.04 = 4%

100 * e^(0.03 * 2) * e^(r * 1) = 100 * e^(0.037 * 3)
r = 0.051 = 5.1%

100 * e^(0.037 * 3) * e^(r * 1) = 100 * e^(0.042 * 4)
r = 0.057 = 5.7%

100 * e^(0.042 * 4) * e^(r * 1) = 100 * e^(0.045 * 5)
r = 0.057 = 5.7%

1 year rate between year 1 and year 2 = 4%
1 year rate between year 2 and year 3 = 5.1%
1 year rate between year 3 and year 4 = 5.7%
1 year rate between year 4 and year 5 = 5.7%

4.15 Use the rates in Problem 4.14 to value an FRA where you will pay 5% (compounded annually) for the third year on $1 million.

Forward interest rate (continuous compounding) for the third year (ie: Between year 2 and 3) is 5.1% (calculated in the last question).
Change this to annual compounding:
e^(r*t) = (1 + r/n)^(n*t)
e^(0.051*1) = (1 + r/1)^(1*1)
r = 0.0523229

Vfra = L(Rf - Rk)(T2-T1)e^(-R2T2)
= $1,000,000 * (0.0523229 - 0.05) * (3 - 2) * e(-0.037*3)
= $2078.85
